# Trapping Rain Water

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
height = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
```

**Output:**

```
6
```

**Explanation:** 6 units of rain water are trapped (shown in blue in the classic illustration).

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
height = [4, 2, 0, 3, 2, 5]
```

**Output:**

```
9
```

## Constraints

- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^5`
